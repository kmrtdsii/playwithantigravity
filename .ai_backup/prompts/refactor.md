# Refactoring Prompt

## Goal
Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability without altering external behavior.

## Steps
1. **Analyze**: Understand the function/module responsibility.
2. **Identify Smells**: Look for long functions, deep nesting, magic numbers, or duplicated code.
3. **Plan**: Decide on extraction or simplification.
4. **Refactor**: Apply changes incrementally.
5. **Verify**: Ensure tests still pass (or logic remains identical).

## Guidelines
- Follow `.ai/guidelines/coding_standards.md`.
- Keep changes atomic.
- Add comments only for "Why", not "What".
